Libraries Used:
-dns.message
-dns.query
-datetime

How to run the program:
I used IDLE, but any IDE will work. Simply run the script by itself, and it will prompt you to enter a domain to query.

Errors are printed whenever a server cannot be reached, so bear with the program if you enter a bad domain. It is alerting you to every failed request
